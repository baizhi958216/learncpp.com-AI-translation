<p>Code::Blocks 20.03 ships with an outdated version of MinGW that only supports C++17 (currently one version back from
    the latest version of C++). If you want to use the latest version of C++ (C++20), you will need to update MinGW. To
    do so, follow this procedure:</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>Install Code::Blocks as per the above.</li>
    <li>Close Code::Blocks if it is open.</li>
    <li>Open Windows File Explorer (Keyboard shortcut <em>Win-E</em>).</li>
    <li>Navigate to your Code::Blocks install directory (probably C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks).</li>
    <li>Rename the “MinGW” directory to “MinGW.bak” (in case something goes wrong).</li>
    <li>Open a browser and navigate to <a href="https://winlibs.com/">https://winlibs.com/</a>.</li>
    <li>Download an updated version of MinGW-w64. You probably want the one under <em>Release Versions -&gt; UCRT
            Runtime -&gt; LATEST -&gt; Win64 -&gt; without LLVM/Clang/LLD/LLDB -&gt; Zip archive</em>.</li>
    <li>Extract the “mingw64” folder to your Code::blocks install directory.</li>
    <li>Rename “mingw64” to “MinGW”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have confirmed the updated compiler works, you can delete the old folder (“MinGW.bak”).</p>

    <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">For Linux users</p>
    <p>Some Linux installations may be missing dependencies needed to run or compile programs with Code::Blocks.</p>
    <p>Debian-based Linux users (such as those on Mint or Ubuntu) may need to install the <em>build-essential</em>
        package. To do so from the terminal command line, type: <code>sudo apt-get install build-essential</code>.</p>
    <p>Arch Linux users may need to install the <em>base-devel</em> package.</p>
    <p>Users on other Linux variants will need to determine what their equivalent package manager and packages are.</p>
</div>
<p>When you launch Code::Blocks for the first time, you may get a <em>Compilers auto-detection</em> dialog. If you do,
    make sure <em>GNU GCC Compiler</em> is set as the default compiler and then select the <em>OK</em> button.</p>

    <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Q: What do I do if I get a "Can’t find compiler executable in your
        configured search paths for GNU GCC Compiler" error?</p>
    <p>Try the following:</p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>If you’re on Windows, make sure you’ve downloaded the version of Code::Blocks WITH MinGW. It’s the one with
            “mingw” in the name.</li>
        <li>Try going to settings, compiler, and choose “reset to defaults”.</li>
        <li>Try going to settings, compiler, toolchain executables tab, and make sure “Compiler’s installation
            directory” is set to the MinGW directory (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW).</li>
        <li>Try doing a full uninstall, then reinstall.</li>

<p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">Visual Studio Code (for experienced
    Linux, macOS, or Windows users)</p>
<p>Visual Studio Code (also called “VS Code”, not to be confused with the similarly named “Visual Studio Community”) is
    a code editor that is a popular choice with experienced developers because it is fast, flexible, open source, works
    for multiple programming languages, and is available for many different platforms.</p>
<p>The downside is that VS Code is much harder to configure correctly than other choices on this list (and on Windows,
    harder to install as well). Before proceeding, we recommend reading through the installation and configuration
    documents linked below to ensure you understand and are comfortable with the steps involved.</p>

<p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">Other macOS IDEs</p>
<p>Other popular Mac choices include <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> (if it is available to you)
    and the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> code editor. Eclipse is not set up to use C++ by default, and
    you will need to install the optional C++ components.</p>
<p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">Other compilers or platforms</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
    <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Q: Can I use a web-based compiler?</p>
    <p>Yes, for some things. While your IDE is downloading (or if you’re not sure you want to commit to installing one
        yet), you can continue this tutorial using a web-based compiler. We recommend one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cpp_online.php">TutorialsPoint</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://wandbox.org/">Wandbox</a> (can choose different versions of GCC or Clang)</li>
        <li><a href="https://godbolt.org/">Godbolt</a> (can see assembly)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Web-based compilers are fine for dabbling and simple exercises. However, they are generally quite limited in
        functionality -- many won’t allow you to create multiple files or effectively debug your programs, and most
        don’t support interactive input. You’ll want to migrate to a full IDE when you can.</p>
</div>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
    <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Q: Can I use a command-line compiler (e.g. g++ on Linux)?</p>
    <p>Yes, but we don’t recommend it for beginners. You’ll need to find your own editor and look up how to use it
        elsewhere. Learning to use a command line debugger is not as easy as an integrated debugger, and will make
        debugging your programs more difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
    <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Q: Can I use other code editors or IDEs, such as Eclipse, Sublime, or
        Notepad++?</p>
    <p>Yes, but we don’t recommend it for beginners. There are many great code editors and IDEs that can be configured
        to support a wide variety of languages, and allow you to mix and match plugins to customize your experience
        however you like. However, many of these editors and IDEs require additional configuration to compile C++
        programs, and there’s a lot that can go wrong during that process. For beginners, we recommend something that
        works out of the box, so you can spend more time learning to code and less time trying to figure out why your
        code editor isn’t working properly with your compiler or debugger.</p>
</div>
<p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">IDEs to avoid</p>
<p>You should avoid the following IDEs altogether because they do not support at least C++11, do not support C++ at all,
    or are no longer actively supported or maintained:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Borland Turbo C++ -- does not support C++11</li>
    <li>Visual Studio for Mac -- does not support C++. (Note: this is a different product than VS Code).</li>
    <li>Dev C++ -- not actively supported</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no good reason to use an outdated or unsupported compiler when lightweight, free alternatives that support
    modern C++ exist.</p>
<p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">When things go wrong (a.k.a. when
    IDE stands for “I don’t even…”)</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin:8px 0;clear:both"></div>
<p>IDE installations seem to cause their fair share of problems. Installation might fail outright (or installation might
    work but the IDE will have problems when you try to use it due to a configuration issue). If you encounter such
    issues, try uninstalling the IDE (assuming it installed in the first place), reboot your machine, disable your
    antivirus or anti-malware temporarily, and try the installation again.</p>
<p>If you’re still encountering issues at this point, you have two options. The easier option is to try a different IDE.
    The other option is to fix the problem. Unfortunately, the causes of installation and configuration errors are
    varied and specific to the IDE software itself, and we’re unable to effectively advise on how to resolve such
    issues. In this case, we recommend copying the error message or problem you are having into your favorite search
    engine (such as Google or Duck Duck Go) and trying to find a forum post elsewhere from some poor soul who has
    inevitably encountered the same issue. Often there will be suggestions on things you can try to remedy the issue.
</p>
<p class="cpp-section cpp-topline" style="clear:both" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">Moving on</p>
<p>Once your IDE is installed (which can be one of the hardest steps if things don’t go as expected), or if you’re
    temporarily proceeding with a web-based compiler, you are ready to write your first program!</p>
