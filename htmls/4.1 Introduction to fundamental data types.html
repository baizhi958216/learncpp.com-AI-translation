  Bits, bytes, and memory addressing
</p>
<p>
  In lesson
  <a
    href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-objects-and-variables/"
    >1.3 -- Introduction to objects and variables</a
  >, we talked about the fact that variables are names for a piece of memory
  that can be used to store information. To recap briefly, computers have random
  access memory (RAM) that is available for programs to use. When a variable is
  defined, a piece of that memory is set aside for that variable.
</p>
<p>
  The smallest unit of memory is a <strong>binary digit</strong> (also called a
  <strong>bit</strong>), which can hold a value of 0 or 1. You can think of a
  bit as being like a traditional light switch -- either the light is off (0),
  or it is on (1). There is no in-between. If you were to look at a random
  segment of memory, all you would see is …011010100101010… or some combination
  thereof.
</p>
<p>
  Memory is organized into sequential units called
  <strong>memory addresses</strong> (or <strong>addresses</strong> for short).
  Similar to how a street address can be used to find a given house on a street,
  the memory address allows us to find and access the contents of memory at a
  particular location.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps surprisingly, in modern computer architectures, each bit does not get
  its own unique memory address. This is because the number of memory addresses
  is limited, and the need to access data bit-by-bit is rare. Instead, each
  memory address holds 1 byte of data. A <strong>byte</strong> is a group of
  bits that are operated on as a unit. The modern standard is that a byte is
  comprised of 8 sequential bits.

  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Key insight</p>
  <p>In C++, we typically work with “byte-sized” chunks of data.</p>
</div>
<p>
  The following picture shows some sequential memory addresses, along with the
  corresponding byte of data:

  <p>
    Some older or non-standard machines may have bytes of a different size (from
    1 to 48 bits) -- however, we generally need not worry about these, as the
    modern de-facto standard is that a byte is 8 bits. For these tutorials,
    we’ll assume a byte is 8 bits.

  Data types
</p>
<p>
  Because all data on a computer is just a sequence of bits, we use a
  <strong>data type</strong> (often called a <strong>type</strong> for short) to
  tell the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful
  way. You have already seen one example of a data type: the integer. When we
  declare a variable as an integer, we are telling the compiler “the piece of
  memory that this variable uses is going to be interpreted as an integer
  value”.
</p>
<p>
  When you give an object a value, the compiler and CPU take care of encoding
  your value into the appropriate sequence of bits for that data type, which are
  then stored in memory (remember: memory can only store bits). For example, if
  you assign an integer object the value <code>65</code>, that value is
  converted to the sequence of bits <code>0100 0001</code> and stored in the
  memory assigned to the object.
</p>
<p>
  Conversely, when the object is evaluated to produce a value, that sequence of
  bits is reconstituted back into the original value. Meaning that
  <code>0100 0001</code> is converted back into the value <code>65</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, the compiler and CPU do all the hard work here, so you generally
  don’t need to worry about how values get converted into bit sequences and
  back.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  All you need to do is pick a data type for your object that best matches your
  desired use.

  Fundamental data types
</p>
<p>
  The C++ language comes with many predefined data types available for your use.
  The most basic of these types are called the
  <strong>fundamental data types</strong> (informally sometimes called
  <strong>basic types</strong> or <strong>primitive types</strong>).
</p>
<p>
  Here is a list of the fundamental data types, some of which you have already
  seen:

  (except <code>std::nullptr_t</code>, which we’ll discuss when we talk about

  Integer vs integral types
</p>
<p>
  In mathematics, an “integer” is a number with no decimal or fractional part,
  including negative and positive numbers and zero. The term “integral” has
  several different meanings, but in the context of C++ is used to mean “like an
  integer”.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>The C++ standard defines the following terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <strong>standard integer types</strong> are <code>short</code>,
    <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>long long</code> (including their
    signed and unsigned variants).
  </li>
  <li>
    The <strong>integral types</strong> are <code>bool</code>, the various char
    types, and the standard integer types.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All integral types are stored in memory as integer values, but only the
  standard integer types will display as an integer value when output. We’ll
  discuss what <code>bool</code> and the char types do when output in their
  respective lessons.
</p>
<p>
  The C++ standard also explicitly notes that “integer types” is a synonym for
  “integral types”. However, conventionally, “integer types” is more often used
  as shorthand for the “standard integer types” instead.
</p>
<p>
  Also note that the term “integral types” only includes fundamental types. This
  means non-fundamental types (such as <code>enum</code> and
  <code>enum class</code>) are not integral types, even when they are stored as
  an integer (and in the case of <code>enum</code>, displayed as one too).
</p>
<p

  Other sets of types
</p>
<p>C++ contains three sets of types.</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  The first two are built-in to the language itself (and do not require the
  inclusion of a header to use):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The “fundamental data types” provide the most the basic and essential data
    types.
  </li>
  <li>
    The “compound data types” provide more complex data types and allow for the
    creation of custom (user-defined) types. We cover these in lesson
    <a
      href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-compound-data-types/"
      >12.1 -- Introduction to compound data types</a
    >.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The distinction between the fundamental and compound types isn’t all that
  interesting or relevant, so it’s generally fine to consider them as a single
  set of types.
</p>
<p>
  The third (and largest) set of types is provided by the C++ standard library.
  Because the standard library is included in all C++ distributions, these types
  are broadly available and have been standardized for compatibility. Use of the
  types in the standard library requires the inclusion of the appropriate header
  and linking in the standard library.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Nomenclature</p>
  <p>
    The term “built-in type” is most often used as a synonym for the fundamental
    data types. However, Stroustrup and others use the term to mean both the
    fundamental and compound data types (both of which are built-in to the core
    language). Since this term isn’t well-defined, we recommend avoiding it
    accordingly.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  A notable omission from the table of fundamental types above is a data type to
  handle <strong>strings</strong> (a sequence of characters that is typically
  used to represent text). This is because in modern C++, strings are part of
  the standard library. Although we’ll be focused on fundamental types in this
  chapter, because basic string usage is straightforward and useful, we’ll
  introduce strings in the next chapter (in lesson
  <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-stdstring/"
    >5.7 -- Introduction to std::string</a
  >).

  The _t suffix
</p>
<p>
  Many of the types defined in newer versions of C++ (e.g.
  <code>std::nullptr_t</code>) use a _t suffix. This suffix means “type”, and
  it’s a common nomenclature applied to modern types.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-6" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  If you see something with a _t suffix, it’s probably a type. But many types
  don’t have a _t suffix, so this isn’t consistently applied.
