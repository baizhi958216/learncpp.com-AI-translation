  A <strong>build configuration</strong> (also called a
  <strong>build target</strong>) is a collection of project settings that
  determines how your IDE will build your project. The build configuration
  typically includes things like what the executable will be named, what
  directories the IDE will look in for other code and library files, whether to
  keep or strip out debugging information, how much to have the compiler
  optimize your program, etc… Generally, you will want to leave these settings
  at their default values unless you have a specific reason to change something.
</p>
<p>
  When you create a new project in your IDE, most IDEs will set up two different
  build configurations for you: a release configuration, and a debug
  configuration.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>debug configuration</strong> is designed to help you debug your
  program, and is generally the one you will use when writing your programs.
  This configuration turns off all optimizations, and includes debugging
  information, which makes your programs larger and slower, but much easier to
  debug. The debug configuration is usually selected as the active configuration
  by default. We’ll talk more about debugging techniques in a later lesson.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>release configuration</strong> is designed to be used when
  releasing your program to the public. This version is typically optimized for
  size and performance, and doesn’t contain the extra debugging information.
  Because the release configuration includes all optimizations, this mode is
  also useful for testing the performance of your code (which we’ll show you how
  to do later in the tutorial series).
</p>
<p>
  When the <em>Hello World</em> program (from lesson
  <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/compiling-your-first-program/"
    >0.7 -- Compiling your first program</a
  >) was built using Visual Studio, the executable produced in the debug
  configuration was 65KB, whereas the executable built in the release version
  was 12KB. The difference is largely due to the extra debugging information
  kept in the debug build.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  Although you can create your own custom build configurations, you’ll rarely
  have a reason to unless you want to compare two builds made using different
  compiler settings.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Best practice</p>
  <p>
    Use the <em>debug</em> build configuration when developing your programs.
    When you’re ready to release your executable to others, or want to test
    performance, use the <em>release</em> build configuration.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Some IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio) also create separate build configurations for
  different platforms. For example, Visual Studio creates build configurations
  for both the x86 (32-bit) and the x64 (64-bit) platforms.

  Switching between build configurations
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightyellowbackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">For Visual Studio users</p>
  <p>
    There are multiple ways to switch between <em>debug</em> and
    <em>release</em> in Visual Studio. The easiest way is to set your selection
    directly from the <em>Solution Configurations</em> dropdown in the
    <em>Standard Toolbar Options</em>:
  </p>
  <div class="cpp-image-wrapper">

      alt="VS Solution Configurations Dropdown"
    />
  </div>
  <p>Set it to <em>Debug</em> for now.</p>
  <p>
    You can also access the configuration manager dialog by selecting
    <em>Build menu &gt; Configuration Manager</em>, and change the
    <em>active solution configuration</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To the right of the <em>Solutions Configurations</em> dropdown, Visual
    Studio also has a <em>Solutions Platform</em> dropdown that allows you to
    switch between x86 (32-bit) and x64 (64-bit) platforms.

  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">For Code::Blocks users</p>
  <p>
    In Code::Blocks, you should see an item called <em>Build Target</em> in the
    <em>Compiler toolbar</em>:
  </p>

      src="https://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Chapter0/CB-BuildTarget-min.png"

<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightyellowbackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">For gcc and Clang users</p>
  <p>
    Add <code>-ggdb</code> to the command line for debug builds and
    <code>-O2 -DNDEBUG</code> for release builds. Use the debug build options
    for now.
  </p>
  <p>
    For GCC and Clang, the <code>-O#</code> option is used to control
    optimization settings. The most common options are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>-O0</code> is the recommended optimization level for debug builds,
      as it disables optimization. This is the default setting.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>-O2</code> is the recommended optimization level for release builds,
      as it applies optimizations that should be beneficial for all programs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>-O3</code> adds additional optimizations that may or may not perform
      better than <code>-O2</code> depending on the specific program. Once your
      program is written, you can try compiling your release build with
      <code>-O3</code> instead of <code>-O2</code> and measure to see which is
      faster.
    </li>
  </ul>

    When you first ran your program, a new file called <em>tasks.json</em> was
    created under the <em>.vscode</em> folder in the explorer pane. Open the
    <em>tasks.json</em> file, find <em>“args”</em>, and then locate the line
    <em>“${file}”</em> within that section.
  </p>
  <p>
    Above the <em>“${file}”</em> line, add a new line containing the following
    command (one per line) when debugging:<br /><code>"-ggdb",</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    Above the <em>“${file}”</em> line, add new lines containing the following

  Modifying build configurations
</p>
<p>
  In the next few lessons, we’ll show you how to tweak some settings in your
  build configurations. Whenever changing a project setting, we recommend making
  the change in all build configurations.
</p>
<p>
  This will help prevent making the change to the wrong build configuration, and
  ensure the change is still applied if you happen to switch build
  configurations later.

  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Tip</p>
  <p>
    Whenever you update your project settings, make the change for all build
    configurations (unless it’s not appropriate for some reason).
