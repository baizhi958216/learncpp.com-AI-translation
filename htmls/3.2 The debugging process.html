  Let’s say you’ve written a program, and it’s not working correctly -- the code
  compiles fine, but when you run it, you’re getting an incorrect result. You
  must have a semantic error somewhere. How can you find it? If you’ve been
  following best practices by writing a little bit of code and then testing it,
  you may have a good idea where your error is. Or you may have no clue at all.
</p>
<p>
  All bugs stem from a simple premise: Something that you thought was correct,
  isn’t. Actually figuring out where that error is can be challenging. In this
  lesson, we’ll outline the general process of debugging a program.
</p>
<p>
  Because we haven’t covered that many C++ topics yet, our example programs in
  this chapter are going to be pretty basic. That may make some of the
  techniques we’re showing here seem excessive. However, keep in mind that these
  techniques are designed to be used with larger, more complex programs, and
  will be of more use in such a setting (which is where you need them most).

  A general approach to debugging
</p>
<p>
  Once a problem has been identified, debugging the problem generally consists
  of six steps:
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

<ol start="1">
  <li>
    Find the root cause of the problem (usually the line of code that’s not
    working). We’ll discuss some strategies on how to do this in the next
    lesson.
  </li>
  <li>Ensure you understand why the issue is occurring.</li>
  <li>Determine how you’ll fix the issue.</li>
  <li>Repair the issue causing the problem.</li>
  <li>Retest to ensure the problem has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Retest to ensure no new problems have emerged.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Let’s use a real-life analogy here. Let’s say one evening, you go to get some
  ice from the ice dispenser in your freezer. You put your cup up to the
  dispenser, press the lever, and … nothing comes out. Uh oh. You’ve discovered
  some kind of defect. What would you do? You’d probably start an investigation
  to see if you could identify the root cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Find the root cause:</strong> Since you hear the ice dispenser trying
  to deliver ice, it’s probably not the ice delivery mechanism itself. So you
  open the freezer, and examine the ice tray. No ice. Is that the root cause of
  the issue? No, it’s another symptom. After further examination, you determine
  that the ice maker does not appear to be making ice. Is the problem the ice
  maker or something else? The freezer is still cold, the water line isn’t
  clogged, and everything else seems to be working, so you conclude that the
  root cause is that the ice maker is non-functional.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Understand the problem:</strong> This is simple in this case. A broken
  ice maker won’t make ice.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Determine a fix:</strong> At this point, you have several options for
  a fix: You could work around the issue (buy bags of ice from the store). You
  could try to diagnose the ice-maker further, to see if there’s a part that can
  be repaired. You could buy a new ice maker and install it in place of the
  current one. Or you could buy a new freezer. You decide to buy a new ice
  maker.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Repair the issue:</strong> Once the ice maker has arrived, you install
  it.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

<p>
  <strong>Retest:</strong> After turning the electricity back on and waiting
  overnight, your new ice maker starts making ice. No new issues are discovered.
</p>
<p>
  Now let’s apply this process to our simple program from the previous lesson:
</p>

  <div class="toolbar">
    <div class="toolbar-item">
      <button
        class="copy-to-clipboard-button"
        type="button"
        data-copy-state="copy"

        <span>Copy</span>
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  This code is nice in one regard: the bug is very apparent, because the wrong
  answer gets printed to the screen via line 10. That gives us a starting point
  for our investigation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Find the root cause:</strong> On line 10, we can see that we’re
  passing in literals for arguments (5 and 3), so there is no room for error
  there. Since the inputs to function <em>add</em> are correct, but the output
  isn’t, it’s pretty apparent that function <em>add</em> must be producing the
  wrong value. The only statement in function <em>add</em> is the return
  statement, which must be the culprit. We’ve found the problem line. Now that
  we know where to focus our attention, noticing that we’re subtracting instead
  of adding is something you’re likely to find via inspection.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Understand the problem:</strong> In this case, it’s obvious why the
  wrong value is being generated -- we’re using the wrong operator.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

<p>
  <strong>Determine a fix:</strong> We’ll simply change <em>operator-</em> to
  <em>operator+</em>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Repair the issue:</strong> This is actually changing
  <em>operator-</em> to <em>operator+</em> and ensuring the program recompiles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Retest:</strong> After implementing the change, rerunning the program
  will indicate that our program now produces the correct value of 8. For this
  simple program, that’s all the testing that’s needed.
</p>
<p>
  This example is trivial, but illustrates the basic process you’ll go through
  when diagnosing any program.
