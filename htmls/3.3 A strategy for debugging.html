  When debugging a program, in most cases the vast majority of your time will be
  spent trying to find where the error actually is. Once the issue is found, the
  remaining steps (fixing the issue and validating that the issue was fixed) are
  often trivial in comparison.
</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’ll start exploring how to find errors.</p>
<p class="cpp-section" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  Finding problems via code inspection
</p>
<p>
  Let’s say you’ve noticed a problem, and you want to track the cause of that
  specific problem down. In many cases (especially in smaller programs), we can
  approximate where the issue is likely to be based on the nature of the error
  and the way the program is structured.
</p>
<p>Consider the following program snippet:</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

<div class="code-toolbar">
  <pre
    class="line-numbers language-cpp"
    tabindex="0"
  ><code class="match-braces language-cpp"><span class="token keyword keyword-int">int</span> <span class="token function">main</span><span class="token punctuation brace-round brace-open brace-level-1" id="pair-66-close">(</span><span class="token punctuation brace-round brace-close brace-level-1" id="pair-66-open">)</span>

    <span class="token keyword keyword-return">return</span> <span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation brace-curly brace-close brace-level-1" id="pair-70-open">}</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span style="height: 16px;"></span><span style="height: 16px;"></span><span style="height: 16px;"></span><span style="height: 16px;"></span><span style="height: 16px;"></span><span style="height: 16px;"></span><span style="height: 16px;"></span><span style="height: 16px;"></span></span><span class="line-numbers-sizer" style="display: none;"></span></code></pre>
  <div class="toolbar">
    <div class="toolbar-item">
      <button
        class="copy-to-clipboard-button"
        type="button"
        data-copy-state="copy"
      >
        <span>Copy</span>
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  If you expected this program to print the names in alphabetical order, but it
  printed them in opposite order instead, the problem is probably in the
  <em>sortNames</em> function. In cases where you can narrow the problem down to
  a specific function, you may be able to spot the issue just by looking at the
  code.
</p>
<p>
  However, as programs get more complex, finding issues by code inspection
  becomes more complex as well.
</p>
<p>
  First, there’s a lot more code to look at. Looking at every line of code in a
  program that is thousands of lines long can take a really long time (not to
  mention it’s incredibly boring). Second, the code itself tends to be more
  complex, with more possible places for things to go wrong. Third, the code’s
  behavior may not give you many clues as to where things are going wrong. If
  you wrote a program to output stock recommendations and it actually output
  nothing at all, you probably wouldn’t have much of a lead on where to start
  looking for the problem.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, bugs can be caused by making bad assumptions. It’s almost impossible
  to visually spot a bug caused by a bad assumption, because you’re likely to
  make the same bad assumption when inspecting the code, and not notice the
  error. So if we have an issue that we can’t find via code inspection, how do
  we find it?

<p>
  Fortunately, if we can’t find an issue via code inspection, there is another
  avenue we can take: we can watch the behavior of the program as it runs, and
  try to diagnose the issue from that. This approach can be generalized as:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Figure out how to reproduce the problem</li>
  <li>
    Run the program and gather information to narrow down where the problem is
  </li>
  <li>Repeat the prior step until you find the problem</li>
</ol>
<p>
  For the rest of this chapter, we’ll discuss techniques to facilitate this
  approach.

  Reproducing the problem
</p>
<p>
  The first and most important step in finding a problem is to be able to
  <em>reproduce the problem</em>. Reproducing the problem means making the
  problem appear in a consistent manner. The reason is simple: it’s extremely
  hard to find an issue unless you can observe it occurring.
</p>
<p>
  Back to our ice dispenser analogy -- let’s say one day your friend tells you
  that your ice dispenser isn’t working. You go to look at it, and it works
  fine. How would you diagnose the problem? It would be very difficult. However,
  if you could actually see the issue of the ice dispenser not working, then you
  could start to diagnose why it wasn’t working much more effectively.
</p>
<p>
  If a software issue is blatant (e.g. the program crashes in the same place
  every time you run it) then reproducing the problem can be trivial. However,
  sometimes reproducing an issue can be a lot more difficult. The problem may
  only occur on certain computers, or in particular circumstances (e.g. when the
  user enters certain input). In such cases, generating a set of reproduction
  steps can be helpful. <strong>Reproduction steps</strong> are a list of clear
  and precise steps that can be followed to cause an issue to recur with a high
  level of predictability. The goal is to be able to cause the issue to reoccur
  as much as possible, so we can run our program over and over and look for
  clues to determine what’s causing the problem. If the issue can be reproduced
  100% of the time, that’s ideal, but less than 100% reproducibility can be
  okay. An issue that occurs only 50% of the time simply means it’ll take twice
  as long to diagnose the issue, as half the time the program won’t exhibit the
  problem and thus not contribute any useful diagnostic information.

  Homing in on issues
</p>
<p>
  Once we can reasonably reproduce the problem, the next step is to figure out
  where in the code the problem is. Based on the nature of the problem, this may
  be easy or difficult. For the sake of example, let’s say we don’t have much of
  an idea where the problem actually is. How do we find it?
</p>
<p>
  An analogy will serve us well here. Let’s play a game of hi-lo. I’m going to
  ask you to guess a number between 1 and 10. For each guess you make, I’ll tell
  you whether each guess is too high, too low, or correct. An instance of this
  game might look like this:
</p>
<pre>
You: 5
Me: Too low
You: 8
Me: Too high
You: 6
Me: Too low
You: 7
Me: Correct
</pre>
<p>
  In the above game, you don’t have to guess every number to find the number I
  was thinking of. Through the process of making guesses and considering the
  information you learn from each guess, you can “home in” on the correct number
  with only a few guesses (if you use an optimal strategy, you can always find
  the number I’m thinking of in 4 or fewer guesses).
</p>
<p>
  We can use a similar process to debug programs. In the worst case, we may have
  no idea where the bug is. However, we do know that the problem must be
  somewhere in the code that executes between the beginning of the program and
  the point where the program exhibits the first incorrect symptom that we can
  observe. That at least rules out the parts of the program that execute after
  the first observable symptom. But that still potentially leaves a lot of code
  to cover. To diagnose the issue, we’ll make some educated guesses about where
  the problem is, with the goal of homing in on the problem quickly.
</p>
<p>
  Often, whatever it was that caused us to notice the problem will give us an
  initial guess that’s close to where the actual problem is. For example, if the
  program isn’t writing data to a file when it should be, then the issue is
  probably somewhere in the code that handles writing to a file (duh!). Then we
  can use a hi-lo like strategy to try and isolate where the problem actually
  is.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    If at some point in our program, we can prove that the problem has not
    occurred yet, this is analogous to receiving a “too low” hi-lo result -- we
    know the problem must be somewhere later in the program. For example, if our
    program is crashing in the same place every time, and we can prove that the
    program has not crashed at a particular point in the execution of the
    program, then the crash must be later in the code.
  </li>
  <li>
    If at some point in our program we can observe incorrect behavior related to
    the problem, then this is analogous to receiving a “too high” hi-lo result,
    and we know the problem must be somewhere earlier in the program. For
    example, let’s say a program prints the value of some variable <em>x</em>.
    You were expecting it to print value <em>2</em>, but it printed
    <em>8</em> instead. Variable <em>x</em> must have the wrong value. If, at
    some point during the execution of our program, we can see that variable
    <em>x</em> already has value <em>8</em>, then we know the problem must have
    occurred before that point.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The hi-lo analogy isn’t perfect -- we can also sometimes remove entire
  sections of our code from consideration without gaining any information on
  whether the actual problem is before or after that point.
</p>
<p>We’ll show examples of all three of these cases in the next lesson.</p>
<p>
  Eventually, with enough guesses and some good technique, we can home in on the
  exact line causing the problem! If we’ve made any bad assumptions, this will
  help us discover where. When you’ve excluded everything else, the only thing
  left must be causing the problem. Then it’s just a matter of understanding
  why.
</p>
<p>
  What guessing strategy you want to use is up to you -- the best one depends on
  what type of bug it is, so you’ll likely want to try many different approaches
  to narrow down the issue. As you gain experience in debugging issues, your
  intuition will help guide you.
</p>
<p>
  So how do we “make guesses”? There are many ways to do so. We’re going to
  start with some simple approaches in the next chapter, and then we’ll build on
  these and explore others in future chapters.
