<p class="cpp-section" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">Uninitialized variables</p>
<p>
  Unlike some programming languages, C/C++ does not automatically initialize
  most variables to a given value (such as zero). When a variable that is not
  initialized is given a memory address to use to store data, the default value
  of that variable is whatever (garbage) value happens to already be in that
  memory address! A variable that has not been given a known value (through
  initialization or assignment) is called an
  <strong>uninitialized variable</strong>.
</p>

  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Nomenclature</p>
  <p>
    Many readers expect the terms “initialized” and “uninitialized” to be strict
    opposites, but they aren’t quite! In common language, “initialized” means
    the object was provided with an initial value at the point of definition.
    “Uninitialized” means the object has not been given a known value yet
    (through any means, including assignment). Therefore, an object that is not
    initialized but is then assigned a value is no longer
    <em>uninitialized</em> (because it has been given a known value).
  </p>
  <p>To recap:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Initialized = The object is given a known value at the point of
      definition.
    </li>
    <li>
      Assignment = The object is given a known value beyond the point of
      definition.
    </li>
    <li>Uninitialized = The object has not been given a known value yet.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Relatedly, consider this variable definition:</p>

    In lesson
    <a
      href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/variable-assignment-and-initialization/"
      >1.4 -- Variable assignment and initialization</a
    >, we noted that when no initializer is provided, the variable is
    default-initialized. In most cases (such as this one),
    default-initialization performs no actual initialization. Thus we’d say
    <code>x</code> is uninitialized. We’re focused on the outcome (the object
    has not been given a known value), not the process.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">As an aside…</p>
  <p>
    This lack of initialization is a performance optimization inherited from C,
    back when computers were slow. Imagine a case where you were going to read
    in 100,000 values from a file. In such case, you might create 100,000
    variables, then fill them with data from the file.
  </p>
  <p>
    If C++ initialized all of those variables with default values upon creation,
    this would result in 100,000 initializations (which would be slow), and for
    little benefit (since you’re overwriting those values anyway).
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, you should always initialize your variables because the cost of
    doing so is minuscule compared to the benefit. Once you are more comfortable
    with the language, there may be certain cases where you omit the
    initialization for optimization purposes. But this should always be done
    selectively and intentionally.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Using the values of uninitialized variables can lead to unexpected results.
  Consider the following short program:
</p>

<p>
  In this case, the computer will assign some unused memory to <em>x</em>. It
  will then send the value residing in that memory location to
  <em>std::cout</em>, which will print the value (interpreted as an integer).
  But what value will it print? The answer is “who knows!”, and the answer may
  (or may not) change every time you run the program. When the author ran this
  program in Visual Studio, <em>std::cout</em> printed the value
  <code>7177728</code> one time, and <code>5277592</code> the next. Feel free to
  compile and run the program yourself (your computer won’t explode).
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightredbackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Warning</p>
  <p>
    Some compilers, such as Visual Studio, <em>will</em> initialize the contents
    of memory to some preset value when you’re using a debug build
    configuration. This will not happen when using a release build
    configuration. Therefore, if you want to run the above program yourself,
    make sure you’re using a <em>release build configuration</em> (see lesson
    <a
      href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/configuring-your-compiler-build-configurations/"
      >0.9 -- Configuring your compiler: Build configurations</a
    >
    for a reminder on how to do that).
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if you run the above program in a Visual Studio debug
    configuration, it will consistently print -858993460, because that’s the
    value (interpreted as an integer) that Visual Studio initializes memory with
    in debug configurations.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Most modern compilers will attempt to detect if a variable is being used
  without being given a value. If they are able to detect this, they will
  generally issue a compile-time warning or error. For example, compiling the
  above program on Visual Studio produced the following warning:
</p>
<p>
  <code
    >c:\VCprojects\test\test.cpp(11) : warning C4700: uninitialized local
    variable 'x' used</code
  >
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  If your compiler won’t let you compile and run the above program (e.g. because
  it treats the issue as an error), here is a possible solution to get around
  this issue:

  Using uninitialized variables is one of the most common mistakes that novice
  programmers make, and unfortunately, it can also be one of the most
  challenging to debug (because the program may run fine anyway if the
  uninitialized variable happened to get assigned to a spot of memory that had a
  reasonable value in it, like 0).
</p>
<p>
  This is the primary reason for the “always initialize your variables” best
  practice.

  Undefined behavior
</p>
<p>
  Using the value from an uninitialized variable is our first example of
  undefined behavior. <strong>Undefined behavior</strong> (often abbreviated
  <strong>UB</strong>) is the result of executing code whose behavior is not
  well-defined by the C++ language. In this case, the C++ language doesn’t have
  any rules determining what happens if you use the value of a variable that has
  not been given a known value. Consequently, if you actually do this, undefined
  behavior will result.
</p>
<p>
  Code implementing undefined behavior may exhibit <em>any</em> of the following
  symptoms:
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<ul>
  <li>Your program produces different results every time it is run.</li>
  <li>Your program consistently produces the same incorrect result.</li>
  <li>
    Your program behaves inconsistently (sometimes produces the correct result,
    sometimes not).
  </li>
  <li>
    Your program seems like it’s working but produces incorrect results later in
    the program.
  </li>
  <li>Your program crashes, either immediately or later.</li>
  <li>Your program works on some compilers but not others.</li>
  <li>
    Your program works until you change some other seemingly unrelated code.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Or, your code may actually produce the correct behavior anyway.</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">

  <p>
    Undefined behavior is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you’re
    going to get!
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  C++ contains many cases that can result in undefined behavior if you’re not
  careful. We’ll point these out in future lessons whenever we encounter them.
  Take note of where these cases are and make sure you avoid them.

  <p>
    One of the most common types of comment we get from readers says, “You said
    I couldn’t do X, but I did it anyway and my program works! Why?”.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are two common answers. The most common answer is that your program is
    actually exhibiting undefined behavior, but that undefined behavior just
    happens to be producing the result you wanted anyway… for now. Tomorrow (or
    on another compiler or machine) it might not.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, sometimes compiler authors take liberties with the language
    requirements when those requirements may be more restrictive than needed.
    For example, the standard may say, “you must do X before Y”, but a compiler
    author may feel that’s unnecessary, and make Y work even if you don’t do X
    first. This shouldn’t affect the operation of correctly written programs,
    but may cause incorrectly written programs to work anyway. So an alternate
    answer to the above question is that your compiler may simply be not
    following the standard! It happens. You can avoid much of this by making
    sure you’ve turned compiler extensions off, as described in lesson
    <a
      href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/configuring-your-compiler-compiler-extensions/"

  Implementation-defined behavior and unspecified behavior
</p>
<p>
  A specific compiler and the associated standard library it comes with are
  called an <strong>implementation</strong> (as these are what actually
  implements the C++ language). In some cases, the C++ language standard allows
  the implementation to determine how some aspect of the language will behave,
  so that the compiler can choose a behavior that is efficient for a given
  platform. Behavior that is defined by the implementation is called
  <strong>implementation-defined behavior</strong>. Implementation-defined
  behavior must be documented and consistent for a given implementation.
</p>
<p>Let’s look at a simple example of implementation-defined behavior:</p>

  <strong>Unspecified behavior</strong> is almost identical to
  implementation-defined behavior in that the behavior is left up to the
  implementation to define, but the implementation is not required to document
  the behavior.

  We generally want to avoid implementation-defined and unspecified behavior, as
