  With many different versions of C++ available (C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14,
  C++17, C++20, C++23, etc…) how does your compiler know which one to use?
  Generally, a compiler will pick a standard to default to. Typically the
  default is <em>not</em> the most recent language standard -- many default to
  C++14, which is missing many of the latest and greatest features.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to use a different language standard (and you probably will),
  you’ll have to configure your IDE/compiler to do so.
</p>
<p>
  The conventional names for language standards (e.g. C++20) are based on the
  year the language standard was published (or expected to be published).
  Because the year of publication is not actually known until it is close,
  language standards that are early in development sometimes use a development
  name instead. For example, C++20 is also known as C++2a.

  Which language standard should you choose?
</p>
<p>
  In professional environments, it’s common to choose a language standard that
  is one or two versions back from the latest finalized standard (e.g. if C++20
  were the latest finalized version, that means C++14 or C++17). This is
  typically done to ensure the compiler makers have had a chance to resolve
  defects, and so that best practices for new features are well understood.
  Where relevant, this also helps ensure better cross-platform compatibility, as
  compilers on some platforms may not provide full support for newer language
  standards immediately.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  For personal projects and while learning, we recommend choosing the latest
  finalized standard, as there is little downside to doing so.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Tip</p>
  <p>
    Many compilers offer “experimental” or “preview” support for features from
    the upcoming non-finalized language standards. Your IDE may offer this as an
    option in the settings where you configure your language standard, or you
    may be able to enable it manually using the upcoming language standard’s
    conventional name or development name.
  </p>
  <p>
    Support for features from non-finalized language standards will be
    incomplete and possibly buggy.

  <p>
    This website currently targets the C++17 standard, meaning our lessons and

  <p>
    To take full advantage of all the lesson content, we recommend using the

  Setting a language standard in Visual Studio
</p>
<p>
  As of the time of writing, Visual Studio 2022 defaults to C++14 capabilities,
  which does not allow for the use of newer features introduced in C++17 and
  C++20.
</p>
<p>
  To use these newer features, you’ll need to enable a newer language standard.
  Unfortunately, there is currently no way to do this globally -- you must do so
  on a project-by-project basis.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightredbackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Warning</p>
  <p>
    With Visual Studio, you will need to reselect your language standard every
    time you create a new project.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  To select a language standard, open your project, then go to
  <em>Project menu &gt; (Your application’s Name)</em> Properties, then open
  <em>Configuration Properties &gt; C/C++ &gt; Language</em>.
</p>

</div>
<p>
  First, make sure the <em>Configuration</em> is set to “All Configurations”.
</p>
<p>
  From there, you can set the <em>C++ Language Standard</em> to the version of
  C++ you wish to use.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Tip</p>
  <p>
    We recommend choosing the latest standard “ISO C++ Latest (/std:c++latest)”,
    which will ensure you can use as many features as your compiler supports.

    Make sure you’re selecting the language standard from the dropdown menu
    (don’t type it out).

  Setting a language standard in Code::Blocks
</p>
<p>
  Code::Blocks may default to a pre-C++11 language standard. You’ll definitely
  want to check and ensure a more modern language standard is enabled.
</p>
<p>
  The good news is that Code::Blocks allows setting your language standard
  globally, so you can set it once (rather than per-project). To do so, go to
  <em>Settings menu &gt; Compiler…</em>:
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

    src="https://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Chapter0/CB-SettingsCompiler-min.png"
    alt="Code::Blocks Settings > Compiler"
  />
</div>
<p>
  Then find the checkboxes labeled
  <em>Have g++ follow the C++XX ISO C++ language standard [-std=c++XX]</em>,
  where XX is some number (e.g. 20, 17, etc…) representing a language standard:
</p>
<div class="cpp-image-wrapper">

    alt="Code::Blocks C++11 setting"
  />
</div>
<p>
  If C++23, C++20, or C++17 appears in this list, select the one that represents
  the latest ISO standard (e.g. select
  <em>Have g++ follow the C++20 ISO language standard</em>). If you see GNU
  standards in this list as well, ignore them.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not see C++17 in this list, upgrade to the latest version of
  Code::Blocks.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightredbackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Warning</p>
  <p>
    As of the time of writing, the current version of Code::Blocks (20.03) is
    using an outdated compiler (GCC 8.1.0).
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend updating your compiler by updating MinGW. The procedure to do
    so can be found under the Code::Blocks section in lesson
    <a

    After updating to the latest version of MinGW, you can see if newer language
    standard checkboxes appear in the
    <em>Settings menu &gt; Compiler…</em> menu. If not, you can manually select
    a C++ version as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Find the “Other compiler options tab” of the “Global Compiler Settings”
      dialog.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add one of the following compiler options: <code>-std=c++11</code>,
      <code>-std=c++14</code>, <code>-std=c++17</code>, <code>-std=c++20</code>,
      or <code>-std=c++23</code> (to enable C++11/14/17/20/23 support
      respectively). You can also try the latest code name (e.g.
      <code>-std=c++2c</code>) for experimental support for features from the
      upcoming language standard.

  For GCC/G++/Clang, you can use compiler options <code>-std=c++11</code>,
  <code>-std=c++14</code>, <code>-std=c++17</code>, <code>-std=c++20</code>, or
  <code>-std=c++23</code> (to enable C++11/14/17/20/23 support respectively). If
  you have GCC 8 or 9, you’ll need to use <code>-std=c++2a</code> for C++20
  support instead. You can also try the latest code name (e.g.
  <code>-std=c++2c</code>) for experimental support for features from the
  upcoming language standard.

  Setting a language standard for VS Code
</p>
<p>
  For VS Code, you can follow the rules above for setting a language standard in
  GCC/G++/Clang.
</p>
<p>
  Place the appropriate language standard flag (including the double quotes and
  comma) in the <code>tasks.json</code> configuration file, in the
  <code>"args"</code> section, on its own line before <code>"${file}"</code>.
</p>
<p>
  We also want to configure Intellisense to use the same language standard. For
  C++20, in <code>settings.json</code>, change or add the following setting on
  its own line: <code>"C_Cpp.default.cppStandard": "c++20"</code>.

  Exporting your configuration
</p>
<p>
  Having to reselect all of your settings options every time you create a new
  project is burdensome. Fortunately, most IDEs provide a way to export your
  settings. This is typically done by creating a new project template with the
  settings you want, and then selecting that project template when you create a
  new project.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightyellowbackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">For Visual Studio users</p>
  <p>
    In Visual Studio, this option is available via Project -&gt; Export
    Template. Select “Project template”, add a name and optional description
    (e.g. C++20 console application), and then click “Finish”.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next time you create a new project, you’ll see this template show up in your
    list of project templates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you create a new project with this template, it may not open any files.
    You can open up your .cpp file in the Solution Explorer window by going to
    Solution -&gt; &lt;Project Name&gt; -&gt; Source Files -&gt; &lt;template
    name&gt;.cpp.

  Where can I view the C++ standards document?
</p>
<p>
  Each C++ language standard is described by a
  <strong>standards document</strong>, which is a formal technical document that
  is the authoritative source for the rules and requirements of a given language
  standard. The standards document is not designed for learning -- rather, it’s
  designed for compiler writers to be able to implement new language standards
  accurately. You will occasionally see people quoting the standards document
  when explaining how something works.
</p>
<p>
  The approved C++ standards document for a given language standard is not
  available for free. There is a link to purchase the latest standard
  <a href="https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard">here</a>.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  When a new language standard is being developed, draft standards documents are
  published for review. These drafts <em>are</em> available online for free. The
  last draft standard before the approved standard is generally close enough to
  the official standard to use for most purposes. You can find the draft
  standards
  <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/standards">here</a>.

  Compilers often have incomplete support for new language features
</p>
<p>
  Even after a language standard is finalized, compilers supporting that
  language standard often still have missing, partial, or buggy support for
  certain features.
</p>
<p>
  If you attempt to compile a program that should compile but mysteriously
  won’t, it’s likely because of one of two reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your compiler is configured to use an older language standard that doesn’t
    support the feature you are using. Try selecting a newer language standard
    and compile your program again. You can use the program in lesson
    <a
      href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/what-language-standard-is-my-compiler-using/"
      >0.13 -- What language standard is my compiler using?</a
    >
    to validate that you have configured your language standard selection
    correctly.
  </li>
  <li>
    The version of the compiler you are running may have missing, partial, or
    buggy support for a feature you are using.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The CPPReference website tracks compiler support for each feature per language
  standard. You can find those support tables linked from their
  <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp">home page</a>, top right, under
  “Compiler Support” (by language standard). For example, you can see which
  C++23 features are supported
  <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/23">here</a>.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-8" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  If a newer version of your compiler supports the problematic feature, you can
  upgrade your compiler to the latest version and try compiling your program
  again. If the latest version of your compiler still doesn’t support the
  feature you are trying to use, you can either try a different compiler that
  does provide support, or find a solution using a different set of features.
