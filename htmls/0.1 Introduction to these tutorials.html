<p>
  Welcome to the Learn C++ tutorials! Above all else, these tutorials aim to
  make learning C++ easy.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike many other sites and books, these tutorials don’t assume you have any
  prior programming experience. We’ll teach you everything you need to know as
  you progress, with <em>lots</em> of examples along the way.
</p>
<p>
  Whether you’re interested in learning C++ as a hobby or for professional
  development, you’re in the right place!

  <p>
    It’s crazy how perfect this website explains C++ concepts and teaches
    programming. I read the book “Programming: Principles and Practice Using
    C++” [by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++] and it was rather
    confusing…. This website makes it clear the first time, and they explain
    everything you need to know. Somehow they know what I don’t know, and what I
    need to know. It’s almost like my future self went back in the past to teach
    me what mistakes I will make.

  Lesson structure
</p>
<p>
  The lessons in this introductory chapter are aimed at giving you some context
  around what C++ is, how it came about, how programs work, and what software
  you need to install to create your own programs. You’ll even write your own
  first program.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  Further chapters will explore different parts of the C++ language. In the
  first chapter (chapter 1), you’ll get a broad but shallow overview of many
  fundamental C++ concepts, so we can start writing some simple programs.
  Further chapters will explore those concepts in depth, or introduce new
  concepts.
</p>
<p>
  Each chapter has a theme, with most of the lessons underneath it being
  generally related to that theme. There is no suggested amount of time that you
  should spend with each lesson or chapter; progress through the material at a
  pace that is comfortable for you.

  Goals
</p>
<p>
  Before we get started, let’s cover a few important goals for these tutorials:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cover general programming topics as well as C++. Traditional textbooks do a
    pretty good job of teaching the basics of a given programming language, but
    they often do not cover other programming topics that are incidental to the
    language. For example, books will omit sections on programming style, common
    pitfalls, debugging, good/bad programming practices, and testing.
    Consequently, by the time you finish the book, you may understand how to
    program in a language, but you might also have picked up bad habits that
    will come back to bite you later! One of the goals of these tutorials is to
    make sure that all of these incidental topics are covered along the way, in
    the sections where it naturally makes sense to discuss them. When you
    finish, you will not only know how to program in C++, you will know how NOT
    to program in C++, which is arguably as important.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Provide a lot of examples. Most people learn as much or more from following
    the examples as they do from reading the text. These tutorials will endeavor
    to provide plenty of clear, concise examples to show the application of
    concepts you are learning. We will also avoid (as much as possible) the twin
    evils: the <em>ellipsis</em> (also known as <em>…</em>), where a necessary
    or non-obvious part of an example is omitted in the interest of space, and
    the <em>unexplained new concept</em>, where a new concept that is integral
    to the example is introduced without any mention of what it is or how it
    works. Both of these tend to lead to getting stuck.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Provide practice programs. The end of many lessons and sections will contain
    some exercises that you can attempt to answer on your own, along with
    solutions. You can compare your solution against ours to see what we did
    differently, or, if you get stuck, how we solved the problem. Then you can
    go back and refocus on the areas you need more work on.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Most importantly: have fun. Programming can be a lot of fun, and if you’re
    not generally having fun, you’re not in the right mindset to be programming.
    Tired or unhappy programmers make mistakes, and debugging code tends to take
    much longer than writing it correctly in the first place! Often you can save
    yourself some time by going to bed, getting a good night’s sleep, and coming
    back to a problem in the morning.
  </li>
</ul>

  Getting the most out of these tutorials
</p>
<p>
  As you go through these tutorials, we recommend a number of practices to
  maximize your learning experience:
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<ul>
  <li>
    Type in the examples <em>by hand</em>. This will help you learn where you
    commonly make errors, as well as becoming familiar with various diagnostic
    messages that result from typos. As you enter each line, think about what it
    does, and how it contributes to the overall program. If you encounter
    anything that you don’t understand, that’s something to investigate further.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    As you make mistakes or find bugs in your programs, fix them. Try to solve
    your own problems before asking others for help. Learning how to find and
    fix errors is a critical skill to successful programming. Don’t neglect
    learning how to use a debugger (we’ll explain how in a future chapter) --
    it’s a key tool in figuring out where your programs are going wrong.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Experiment with the examples. Change numbers and text to see what happens.
    Modify the programs to do additional things (e.g. if a program adds two
    numbers, make it add three numbers). Try to find different ways to break the
    programs (if a program asks you to enter a number, try entering a letter
    instead and see what happens). You’ll learn more by modifying the examples
    than by simply following them.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Plan to spend some time with the quizzes. If you’re new to programming, you
    may find these challenging (and that’s normal, as your brain acclimates to
    the programming mindset). Don’t be discouraged if you don’t get the right
    answer the first time. You may need to try several different approaches
    before you find a path to success. It’s okay to look at the answer if you’re
    really stuck. Just make sure you understand how the provided answer works
    before proceeding.
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Write your own short programs using the concepts you have learned. This will
    reinforce your learning and improve your retention.
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, there is not. The site is able to stay free for everyone
    because we’re ad-sponsored -- that model simply doesn’t work in PDF format.
    You are welcome to convert pages from this website into PDF (or any other)

    Q: What should I do if I get stuck on a concept?
  </p>
  <p>If you don’t understand something or feel stuck:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Read through the comments. Other readers may have encountered similar
      challenges.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scan through the next lesson or two in the series -- your question may be
      answered there.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use a search engine to see if your question (or error message) has been
      addressed elsewhere.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask an AI to explain something to you. Keep in mind that the information
      provided by AI may be fully or partially incorrect.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask your question on a site that is designed for programming Q&amp;A, like
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If all else fails, skip the material you don’t understand, and come back to
    it later. You may find that something that was hard to understand is easier
    with the additional knowledge and context provided by other articles.

  <p>
    Use our <a href="/learn-c-site-index/">Site index</a> to look up any topics
    you want to know more about there, and you’ll find links to the lessons
    where that topic is discussed. The site index is also accessible from every

    Nope. Maintaining this site requires a <em>lot</em> of time. Doing other
