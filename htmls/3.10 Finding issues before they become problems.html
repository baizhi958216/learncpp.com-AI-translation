  When you make a semantic error, that error may or may not be immediately
  noticeable when you run your program. An issue may lurk undetected in your
  code for a long time before newly introduced code or changed circumstances
  cause it to manifest as a program malfunction. The longer an error sits in the
  code base before it is found, the more likely it is to be hard to find, and
  something that may have been easy to fix originally turns into a debugging
  adventure that eats up time and energy.
</p>
<p>So what can we do about that?</p>

  Don’t make errors
</p>
<p>
  Well, the best thing is to not make errors in the first place. Here’s a list
  of things that can help avoid making errors:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Follow best practices.</li>
  <li>
    Don’t program when tired or frustrated. Take a break and come back later.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand where the common pitfalls are in a language (all those things we
    warn you not to do).
  </li>
  <li>Don’t let your functions get too long.</li>
  <li>
    Prefer using the standard library to writing your own code, when possible.
  </li>
  <li>Comment your code liberally.</li>
  <li>Start with simple solutions, then layer in complexity incrementally.</li>
  <li>Avoid clever/non-obvious solutions.</li>
  <li>Optimize for readability and maintainability, not performance.</li>
</ul>

  <p>
    Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the
    first place. So if you’re as clever as you can be when you write it, how
    will you ever debug it?

  Refactoring your code
</p>
<p>
  As you add new capabilities to your programs (“behavioral changes”), you will
  find that some of your functions grow in length. As functions get longer, they
  get both more complex and harder to understand.
</p>
<p>
  One way to address this is to break a single long function into multiple
  shorter functions. This process of making structural changes to your code
  without changing its behavior is called <strong>refactoring</strong>. The goal
  of refactoring is to make your program less complex by increasing its
  organization and modularity.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

<p>
  So how long is too long for a function? A function that takes up one vertical
  screen worth of code is generally regarded as too long -- if you have to
  scroll to read the whole function, the function’s comprehensibility drops
  significantly. Ideally, a function should be less than ten lines. Functions
  that are less than five lines are even better.
</p>
<p>
  Remember that the goal here is to maximize comprehension and maintainability,
  not to minimize function length -- abandoning best practices or using obscure
  coding techniques to save a line or two doesn’t do your code any favors.

  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Key insight</p>
  <p>
    When making changes to your code, make behavioral changes OR structural
    changes, and then retest for correctness. Making behavioral and structural
    changes at the same time tends to lead to more errors as well as errors that
    are harder to find.

  An introduction to defensive programming
</p>
<p>
  Errors can be not only of your own making (e.g. incorrect logic), but also
  occur when your users use the application in a way that you did not
  anticipate. For example, if you ask the user to enter an integer, and they
  enter a letter instead, how does your program behave in such a case? Unless
  you anticipated this, and added some error handling for this case, probably
  not very well.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Defensive programming</strong> is a practice whereby the programmer
  tries to anticipate all of the ways the software could be misused, either by
  end-users, or by other developers (including the programmer themselves) using
  the code. These misuses can often be detected and then mitigated (e.g. by
  asking a user who entered bad input to try again).
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

<p>We’ll explore topics related to error handling in future lessons.</p>

  Finding errors fast
</p>
<p>
  Since not making errors is difficult in large programs, the next best thing is
  to catch errors you do make quickly.
</p>
<p>
  The best way to do this is to program a little bit at a time, and then test
  your code and make sure it works.
</p>
<p>However, there are a few other techniques we can also use.</p>

</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

<p>
  One common way to help uncover issues with your program is to write testing
  functions to “exercise” the code you’ve written. Here’s a primitive attempt,
  more for illustrative purposes than anything:

  The testadd() function tests the add() function by calling it with different
  values. If all the values match our expectations, then we can be reasonably
  confident the function works. Even better, we can keep this function around,
  and run it any time we change function <em>add</em> to ensure we haven’t
  accidentally broken it.
</p>
<p>
  This is a primitive form of <strong>unit testing</strong>, which is a software
  testing method by which small units of source code are tested to determine
  whether they are correct.
</p>
<p>
  As with logging frameworks, there are many 3rd party unit testing frameworks
  that can be used. It’s also possible to write your own, though we’ll need more
  language features at our disposal to do the topic justice. We’ll come back to
  some of this in a future lesson.

  An introduction to constraints
</p>
<p>
  Constraints-based techniques involve the addition of some extra code (that can
  be compiled out in a non-debug build, if desired) to check that some set of
  assumptions or expectations are not violated.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>

<p>
  For example, if we were writing a function to calculate the factorial of a
  number, which expects a non-negative argument, the function could check to
  make sure the caller passed in a non-negative number before proceeding. If the
  caller passes in a negative number, then the function could immediately error
  out rather than producing some indeterminate result, helping ensure the
  problem is caught immediately.
</p>
<p>
  One common method of doing this is via <em>assert</em> and
  <em>static_assert</em>, which we cover in lesson
  <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/assert-and-static_assert/"
    >9.6 -- Assert and static_assert</a

  Shotgunning for general issues
</p>
<p>
  Programmers tend to make certain kinds of common mistakes, and some of those
  mistakes can be discovered by programs trained to look for them. These
  programs, generally known as <strong>static analysis tools</strong> (sometimes
  informally called <em>linters</em>) are programs that analyze your source code
  to identify specific semantic issues (in this context, <em>static</em> means
  that these tools analyze the source code without executing it). The issues
  found by static analysis tools may or may not be the cause of any particular
  problem you are having, but may help point out fragile areas of code or issues
  that can be problematic in certain circumstances.
</p>
<p>
  You already have one static analysis tool at your disposal -- your compiler!
  In addition to ensuring your program is syntactically correct, most modern C++
  compilers will do some light static analysis to identify some common problems.
  For example, many compilers will warn you if you try to use a variable that
  has not been initialized. If you haven’t already, turning up your compiler
  warning and error levels (see lesson
  <a
    href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/configuring-your-compiler-warning-and-error-levels/"
    >0.11 -- Configuring your compiler: Warning and error levels</a
  >) can help surface these.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis#C,_C++"
    >Many static analysis tools exist</a
  >, some of which can identify over 300 types of programming errors. On our
  small academic programs, use of a static analysis tool is optional, but using
  one may help you find areas where your code is non-compliant with best
  practices. On large programs, use of a static analysis tool is highly
  recommended, as it can surface tens or hundreds of potential issues.
