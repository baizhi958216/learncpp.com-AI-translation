<p class="cpp-section" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">Before C++, there was C</p>
<p>
  The C language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone
  laboratories, primarily as a systems programming language (a language to write
  operating systems with). Ritchie’s primary goals were to produce a
  minimalistic language that was easy to compile, allowed efficient access to
  memory, produced efficient code, and was self-contained (not reliant on other
  programs). For a high-level language, C was designed to give the programmer a
  lot of control, while allowing developers to write a program that could be run
  on different platforms.
</p>
<p>
  C ended up being so efficient and flexible that in 1973, Ritchie and Ken
  Thompson rewrote most of the Unix operating system using C. Many previous
  operating systems had been written in assembly. Unlike assembly, which
  produces programs that can only run on specific CPUs, C has excellent
  portability, allowing Unix to be easily recompiled on many different types of
  computers and speeding its adoption. C and Unix had their fortunes tied
  together, and C’s popularity was in part tied to the success of Unix as an
  operating system.
</p>
<p>
  In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published a book called “The C
  Programming Language”. This book, which was commonly known as K&amp;R (after
  the authors’ last names), provided an informal specification for the language
  and became a de facto standard. When maximum portability was needed,
  programmers would stick to the recommendations in K&amp;R, because most
  compilers at the time were implemented to K&amp;R standards.
</p>
<p>
  In 1983, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a committee
  to establish a formal standard for C. In 1989 (committees take forever to do
  anything), they finished, and released the C89 standard, more commonly known
  as ANSI C. In 1990 the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
  adopted ANSI C (with a few minor modifications). This version of C became
  known as C90. Compilers eventually became ANSI C/C90 compliant, and programs
  desiring maximum portability were coded to this standard.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  In 1999, the ISO committee released a new version of C informally named C99.
  C99 adopted many features which had already made their way into compilers as
  extensions, or had been implemented in C++.

  C++
</p>
<p>
  C++ (pronounced “see plus plus”) was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell
  Labs as an extension to C, starting in 1979. C++ adds many new features to the
  C language, and is perhaps best thought of as a superset of C, though this is
  not strictly true (as C99 introduced a few features that do not exist in C++).
  C++’s most notable innovation over C is that it supports object-oriented
  programming. As for what an “object” is and how it differs from traditional
  programming methods, well, we’ll cover that in later chapters.
</p>
<p>
  C++ was standardized in 1998 by the ISO committee. This means the ISO
  standards committee approved a document (called a
  <strong>standards document</strong>) that provides a formal description of the
  C++ language. The goal of standardization is to help ensure that C++ code
  behaves consistently across different compilers and platforms.
</p>
<p>
  A minor update to the language was published in 2003 (informally named C++03).
</p>
<p>
  Five major updates to the C++ language (informally named C++11, C++14, C++17,
  C++20, and C++23) have been made since then, each adding additional
  functionality. C++11 in particular added a huge number of new capabilities,
  and is widely considered to be the new baseline version of the language.
  Future upgrades to the language are expected every three or so years.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  Because the official name of the approved standards is complex (C++20’s formal
  name is ISO/IEC 14882:2020), standards are conventionally referred to by
  informal names, which include the last two digits of the year of publication
  (or expected publication). For example, C++20 refers to the version of the
  language published in 2020.

  C and C++’s philosophy
</p>
<p>
  The underlying design philosophy of C and C++ can be summed up as “trust the
  programmer” -- which is both wonderful and dangerous. C++ is designed to allow
  the programmer a high degree of freedom to do what they want. However, this
  also means the language often won’t stop you from doing things that don’t make
  sense, because it will assume you’re doing so for some reason it doesn’t
  understand. There are quite a few pitfalls that new programmers are likely to
  fall into if caught unaware. This is one of the primary reasons why knowing
  what you shouldn’t do in C/C++ is almost as important as knowing what you
  should do.

  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Q: What is C++ good at?</p>
  <p>
    C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over
    memory and other resources is needed. Here are a few types of applications
    that C++ would excel in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Video games</li>
    <li>Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc…)</li>
    <li>
      High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
    </li>
    <li>Graphical applications and simulations</li>
    <li>Productivity / office applications</li>
    <li>Embedded software</li>
    <li>Audio and video processing</li>
    <li>Artificial intelligence and neural networks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    C++ also has a large number of high-quality 3rd party libraries available,
    which can shorten development times significantly.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Q: Isn’t C++ dying?</p>
  <p>
    Nope. Surveys consistently indicate that C++ is the 2nd or 3rd most popular
    compiled language (behind Java and sometimes C#, and just ahead of C), and
    the 5th or 6th most popular language overall (excluding HTML, SQL, and shell
    scripting languages).
  </p>
  <p>
    C++ is one of the most popular languages for learning to code, owing to the
    abundance of teaching resources, the large community, and the number of
    college courses that teach it.
  </p>
  <p>
    With language updates every three years, a huge number of useful third party
    libraries, and dominance in the ever-popular video game industry, C++
    continues to thrive.

    Q: Do I need to know C before I do these tutorials?
  </p>
  <p>
    Nope! It’s perfectly fine to start with C++, and we’ll teach you everything
    you need to know (including pitfalls to avoid) along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you know C++, it should be pretty easy to learn standard C if you ever
    have the need. These days, C is mostly used for niche use cases: code that
    runs on embedded devices, when you need to interact with other languages
    that can only interface with C, etc… For most other cases, C++ is
    recommended.
