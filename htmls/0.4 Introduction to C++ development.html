  Before we can write and execute our first C++ program, we need to understand
  in more detail how C++ programs get developed. Here is a graphic outlining a
  simplistic approach:

  Step 1: Define the problem that you would like to solve
</p>
<p>
  This is the “what” step, where you figure out what problem you are intending
  to solve. Coming up with the initial idea for what you would like to program
  can be the easiest step, or the hardest. But conceptually, it is the simplest.
  All you need is an idea that can be well defined, and you’re ready for the
  next step.
</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    “I want to write a program that will allow me to enter many numbers, then
    calculates the average.”
  </li>
  <li>
    “I want to write a program that generates a 2d maze and lets the user
    navigate through it. The user wins if they reach the end.”
  </li>
  <li>
    “I want to write a program that reads in a file of stock prices and predicts
    whether the stock will go up or down.”
  </li>
</ul>
<p

  style="clear: both"

>
  Step 2: Determine how you are going to solve the problem
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  This is the “how” step, where you determine how you are going to solve the
  problem you came up with in step 1. It is also the step that is most neglected
  in software development. The crux of the issue is that there are many ways to
  solve a problem -- however, some of these solutions are good and some of them
  are bad. Too often, a programmer will get an idea, sit down, and immediately
  start coding a solution. This often generates a solution that falls into the
  bad category.
</p>
<p>Typically, good solutions have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are straightforward (not overly complicated or confusing).</li>
  <li>
    They are well documented (especially around any assumptions being made or
    limitations).
  </li>
  <li>
    They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without
    impacting other parts of the program.
  </li>
  <li>
    They can recover gracefully or give useful error messages when something
    unexpected happens.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When you sit down and start coding right away, you’re typically thinking “I
  want to do &lt;something&gt;”, so you implement the solution that gets you
  there the fastest. This can lead to programs that are fragile, hard to change
  or extend later, or have lots of bugs. A <strong>bug</strong> is any kind of
  programming error that prevents the program from operating correctly.

  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">As an aside…</p>
  <p>
    The term <em>bug</em> was first used by Thomas Edison back in the 1870s!
    However, the term was popularized in the 1940s when engineers found an
    actual moth stuck in the hardware of an early computer, causing a short
    circuit. Both the log book in which the error was reported and the moth are
    now part of the Smithsonian Museum of American History. It can be viewed

<p>
  Various studies have shown that on complex software systems, only 10-40% of a
  programmer’s time is actually spent writing the initial program. The other
  60-90% is spent on maintenance, which can consist of
  <strong>debugging</strong> (removing bugs), updates to cope with changes in
  the environment (e.g. to run on a new OS version), enhancements (minor changes
  to improve usability or capability), or internal improvements (to increase
  reliability or maintainability)<a

</p>
<p>
  Consequently, it’s worth your time to spend a little extra time up front
  (before you start coding) thinking about the best way to tackle a problem,
  what assumptions you are making, and how you might plan for the future, in
  order to save yourself a lot of time and trouble down the road.

  We’ll talk more about how to effectively design solutions to problems in a
  future lesson.

  Step 3: Write the program
</p>
<p>
  In order to write the program, we need two things: First, we need knowledge of
  a programming language -- that’s what these tutorials are for! Second, we need
  a text editor to write and save our C++ programs. The set of C++ instructions
  that we input into the text editor is called the program’s
  <strong>source code</strong> (often shortened to just <strong>code</strong>).
  It’s possible to write a program using any text editor you want, even
  something as simple as Windows’ notepad or Unix’s vi or pico.
</p>
<p>A program typed into a basic text editor would look something like this:</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Here is some text.";
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
  However, we strongly urge you to use an editor that is designed for
  programming (called a <strong>code editor</strong>). Don’t worry if you don’t
  have one yet. We’ll cover how to install a code editor shortly.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  A typical editor designed for coding has a few features that make programming
  much easier, including:
</p>
<ol start="1">
  <li>
    Line numbering. Line numbering is useful when the compiler gives us an
    error, as a typical compiler error will state:
    <em>some error code/message, line 64</em>. Without an editor that shows line
    numbers, finding line 64 can be a real hassle.
  </li>
  <li>
    Syntax highlighting and coloring. Syntax highlighting and coloring changes
    the color of various parts of your program to make it easier to identify the
    different components of your program.
  </li>
  <li>
    An unambiguous, fixed-width font (often called a “monospace font”).
    Non-programming fonts often make it hard to distinguish between the number 0
    and the letter O, or between the number 1, the letter l (lower case L), and
    the letter I (upper case i). A good programming font will ensure these
    symbols are visually differentiated in order to ensure one isn’t
    accidentally used in place of the other. All code editors should have this
    enabled by default, but a standard text editor might not. Using a
    fixed-width font (where all symbols have the same width) makes it easier to
    properly format and align your code.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Here’s an example of a C++ program with line numbering, syntax highlighting,
  and a fixed-width font:
</p>
<div class="code-toolbar">
  <pre
    class="line-numbers language-cpp"
    tabindex="0"
  ><code class="match-braces language-cpp"><span class="token macro property"><span class="token directive-hash">#</span><span class="token directive keyword">include</span> <span class="token string">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span>

  <div class="toolbar">
    <div class="toolbar-item">
      <button
        class="copy-to-clipboard-button"
        type="button"
        data-copy-state="copy"
      >
        <span>Copy</span>
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Note how much easier this is to understand than the non-highlighted version.
  The source code we show in this tutorial will have both line numbering and
  syntax highlighting to make that code easier to follow.

  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Tip</p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.codingfont.com/">Coding Font</a> and
    <a href="https://www.programmingfonts.org">Programming Fonts</a> both have
    neat tools that allow you to compare different coding fonts to see which
    ones you like best.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">For advanced readers</p>
  <p>
    Because source code is written using ASCII characters, programming languages
    use a certain amount of ASCII art to represent mathematical concepts. For
    example, <code>≠</code> is not part of the ASCII character set, so
    programming languages typically use <code>!=</code> to represent
    mathematical inequality instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some programming fonts, such as
    <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a>, use ligatures to
    combine such “art” back into a single character. For example, instead of
    displaying <code>!=</code>, Fira Code will display <code>≠</code> (using the
    same width as the two-character version). Some people find this easier to
    read, others prefer sticking with a more literal interpretation of the
    underlying characters.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Many simple C++ programs only have one source code file, but complex C++
  programs can have hundreds or even thousands of source code files.
</p>
<p>
  Each source code file in your program will need to be saved to disk, which
  means each source code file needs a filename. C++ does not have any
  requirements for naming files. However, the de-facto standard is to name the
  first/primary source file created for a program <code>main.cpp</code>. The
  filename (<code>main</code>) makes it easy to determine which is the primary
  source code file, and the <code>.cpp</code> extension indicates that the file
  is a C++ source code file.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  You may occasionally see the first/primary source code file named after the
  name of the program instead (e.g. <code>calculator.cpp</code>,
  <code>poker.cpp</code>). You may also occasionally see other extensions used
  (e.g. <code>.cc</code> or <code>.cxx</code>).
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgreenbackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Best practice</p>
  <p>
    Name the first/primary source code file in each program
    <code>main.cpp</code>. This makes it easy to determine which source code
    file is the primary one.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Once you’ve written your program, the next steps are to convert the source
  code into something that can be run, and then see whether it works! We’ll
  discuss those steps (4-7) in the next lesson.
