<p class="cpp-section" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">Chapter introduction</p>
<p>Welcome to the first primary chapter of these C++ tutorials!</p>
<p>
  In this chapter, we’ll take a first look at a number of topics that are
  essential to every C++ program. Because there are quite a few topics to cover,
  we’ll cover most at a fairly shallow level (just enough to get by). The goal
  of this chapter is to help you understand how basic C++ programs are
  constructed. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to write your own
  simple programs.
</p>
<p>
  In future chapters, we’ll revisit the majority of these topics and explore
  them in more detail. We’ll also introduce new concepts that build on top of
  these.
</p>
<p>
  In order to keep the lesson lengths manageable, topics may be split over
  several subsequent lessons. If you feel like some important concept isn’t
  covered in a lesson, or you have a question that isn’t answered in the current
  lesson, it’s possible that it’s covered in the next lesson.

  Statements
</p>
<p>
  A computer program is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what
  to do. A <strong>statement</strong> is a type of instruction that causes the
  program to <em>perform some action</em>.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  Statements are by far the most common type of instruction in a C++ program.
  This is because they are the smallest independent unit of computation in the
  C++ language. In that regard, they act much like sentences do in natural
  language. When we want to convey an idea to another person, we typically write
  or speak in sentences (not in random words or syllables). In C++, when we want
  to have our program do something, we typically write statements.
</p>
<p>
  Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon. If you see a line
  that ends in a semicolon, it’s probably a statement.
</p>
<p>
  In a high-level language such as C++, a single statement may compile into many
  machine language instructions.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">For advanced readers</p>
  <p>There are many different kinds of statements in C++:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Declaration statements</li>
    <li>Jump statements</li>
    <li>Expression statements</li>
    <li>Compound statements</li>
    <li>Selection statements (conditionals)</li>
    <li>Iteration statements (loops)</li>
    <li>Try blocks</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By the time you’re through with this tutorial series, you’ll understand what
    all of these are!

  Functions and the <code>main</code> function
</p>
<p>
  In C++, statements are typically grouped into units called functions. A
  <strong>function</strong> is a collection of statements that get executed
  sequentially (in order, from top to bottom). As you learn to write your own
  programs, you’ll be able to create your own functions and mix and match
  statements in any way you please (we’ll show how in a future lesson).
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightpurplebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Rule</p>
  <p>
    Every C++ program must have a special function named
    <strong>main</strong> (all lower case letters).
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  When the program is run, the statements inside of <code>main</code> are
  executed in sequential order.
</p>
<p>
  Programs typically terminate (finish running) after the last statement inside
  function <code>main</code> has been executed (though programs may abort early
  in some circumstances, or do some cleanup afterwards).
</p>
<p>
  Functions are typically written to do a specific job or perform some useful
  action. For example, a function named <code>max</code> might contain
  statements that figures out which of two numbers is larger. A function named
  <code>calculateGrade</code> might calculate a student’s grade from a set of
  test scores. A function named <code>printEmployee</code> might print an
  employee’s information to the console. We will talk a lot more about functions
  soon, as they are the most commonly used organizing tool in a program.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Nomenclature</p>
  <p>
    When discussing functions, it’s fairly common shorthand to append a pair of
    parenthesis to the end of the function’s name. For example, if you see the
    term <code>main()</code> or <code>doSomething()</code>, this is shorthand
    for functions named <code>main</code> or
    <code>doSomething</code> respectively. This helps differentiate functions
    from other things with names (such as variables) without having to write the
    word “function” each time.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  In programming, the name of a function (or object, type, template, etc…) is
  called its <strong>identifier</strong>.

  Characters and text
</p>
<p>
  The earliest computers were designed primarily for mathematical calculations
  and data processing. As hardware improved, networking became accessible, and
  consumer software evolved, computers also became valuable tools for written
  communication.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  In written language, the most basic unit of communication is the character. To
  simplify slightly, a <strong>character</strong> is a written symbol or mark,
  such as a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or mathematical symbol. When we tap
  an alphabetic or numeric key on our keyboard, a character is produced as a
  result, which can then be displayed on the screen. The following are all
  characters: <code>a</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>$</code>, and
  <code>=</code>.
</p>
<p>
  In many cases, such as when writing words or sentences, we want to make use of
  more than one character. A sequence of characters is called
  <strong>text</strong> (also called a <strong>string</strong> in programming
  contexts).
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Nomenclature</p>
  <p>
    Conventionally, the term “text” is also used to mean
    <strong>plain text</strong>, which is text that contains only characters
    that appear on a standard keyboard, with no special formatting or styling.
    For example, plain text cannot represent bold words, as that requires
    styling.
  </p>
  <p>Our C++ programs are written as plain text.</p>
</div>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightgraybackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">For advanced readers</p>
  <p>
    Computers have an additional type of character, called a “control
    character”. These are characters that have special meaning to the computer
    system, but either aren’t intended to be displayed, or display as something
    other than a single visible symbol. Examples of well-known control
    characters include “escape” (which doesn’t display anything), “tab” (which
    displays as some number of spaces), and “backspace” (which erases the
    previous character).

  Dissecting Hello world!
</p>
<p>
  Now that you have a brief understanding of what statements and functions are,
  let’s return to our “Hello world” program and take a high-level look at what
  each line does in more detail.
</p>

      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Line 1 is a special type of line called a preprocessor directive. This
  <code>#include</code> preprocessor directive indicates that we would like to
  use the contents of the <code>iostream</code> library, which is the part of
  the C++ standard library that allows us to read and write text from/to the
  console. We need this line in order to use <code>std::cout</code> on line 5.
  Excluding this line would result in a compile error on line 5, as the compiler
  wouldn’t otherwise know what <code>std::cout</code> is.
</p>
<p>
  Line 2 is blank, and is ignored by the compiler. This line exists only to help
  make the program more readable to humans (by separating the
  <code>#include</code> preprocessor directive and the subsequent parts of the
  program).
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  Line 3 tells the compiler that we’re going to write (define) a function whose
  name (identifier) is <code>main</code>. As you learned above, every C++
  program must have a <code>main</code> function or it will fail to link. This
  function will produce a value whose type is <code>int</code> (an integer).
</p>
<p>
  Lines 4 and 7 tell the compiler which lines are part of the
  <em>main</em> function. Everything between the opening curly brace on line 4
  and the closing curly brace on line 7 is considered part of the
  <code>main</code> function. This is called the function body.
</p>
<p>
  Line 5 is the first statement within function <code>main</code>, and is the
  first statement that will execute when we run our program.
  <code>std::cout</code> (which stands for “character output”) and the
  <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator allow us to display information on the console.
  In this case, we’re displaying the text <code>Hello world!</code>. This
  statement creates the visible output of the program.
</p>
<p>
  Line 6 is a return statement. When an executable program finishes running, the
  program sends a value back to the operating system in order to indicate
  whether it ran successfully or not. This particular return statement returns
  the integer value <code>0</code> to the operating system, which means
  “everything went okay!”. This is the last statement in the program that
  executes.
</p>
<p>
  All of the programs we write will follow this general template, or a variation
  on it.

    If parts (or all) of the above explanation are confusing, that’s to be
    expected at this point. This was just to provide a quick overview.
    Subsequent lessons will dig into all of the above topics, with plenty of
    additional explanation and examples.

  Syntax and syntax errors
</p>
<p>
  In the English language, sentences are constructed according to specific
  grammatical rules that you probably learned in English class in school. For
  example, in writing, normal sentences end in a period. The set of rules that
  describe how specific words (and punctuation) can be arranged to form valid
  sentences in a language is called <strong>syntax</strong>. For example, “My
  house painted is blue” is a syntax error, because the ordering of the words is
  unconventional. “All your base are belong to us!” is another notable one.
</p>
<p>
  The C++ programming language also has a syntax, which describes how the
  elements of your program must be written and arranged in order for the program
  to be considered valid. When you compile your program, the compiler is
  responsible for making sure your program follows these syntactical rules. If
  your program does something that deviates from the syntax of the language, the
  compiler will halt compilation and issue a <em>_syntax error</em>.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike the English language, which allows for a lot of ambiguity, the syntax
  rules of C++ are strictly defined and upheld. Syntax errors are common.
  Fortunately, such errors are typically straightforward to find and fix, as the
  compiler will generally point you right at them. Compilation of a program will
  only complete once all syntax errors are resolved.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  Since the syntax for most statements requires those statements to end in a
  semicolon, let’s see what happens if we omit the semicolon on line 5 of the
  “Hello world” program, like this:
</p>
<div class="code-toolbar">

    <div class="toolbar-item">

        type="button"
        data-copy-state="copy"
      >
        <span>Copy</span>
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Feel free to compile this ill-formed program yourself.</p>
<p>When compiled using Clang, the following error message is generated:</p>
<pre>
prog.cc:5:31: error: expected ';' after expression
</pre>
<p>
  Clang is telling us that on line 5 at the 31st character, the syntax rules
  require a semicolon, but we did not provide one. Therefore, compilation was
  halted with an error.
</p>
<p>
  When compiled with Visual Studio instead, the compiler produces this
  compilation error:
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-8" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<pre>
c:\vcprojects\hello.cpp(6): error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'return'
</pre>
<p>
  Note that Visual Studio says the error was encountered on line 6 (instead of
  on line 5). So who is right? Both are, in a way.
</p>
<p>
  Clang knows we conventionally put semicolons at the end of statements, so it
  is reporting that the error is on line 5 based on the assumption that we will
  do so. Visual Studio is opting to report the line it was compiling when it
  determined that the error occurred (on line 6, when it encountered
  <code>return</code> instead of the expected semicolon).
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Key insight</p>
  <p>
    Compilers will sometimes report that an error has occurred on the line after
    the one where we’d conventionally fix the issue. If you can’t find the error
    on the line indicated, check the prior line.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  To see other different error messages, experiment with deleting characters or
  even whole lines from the “Hello world” program. Also try restoring the
  missing semicolon at the end of line 5, and then deleting lines 1, 3, or 4 to
  see what happens.
