  Congratulations! You made it all the way through the primary portion of the
  tutorial! In the preceding lessons, we covered many of the principal C++
  language features (including a few from the C++11/14/17 extension to the
  language).
</p>
<p>
  So the obvious question is, “what next?”. One thing you’ve probably noticed is
  that an awful lot of programs use the same concepts over and over again:
  loops, strings, arrays, sorting, etc… You’ve probably also noticed that
  programs written using non-class versions of containers and common algorithms
  are error-prone. The good news is that C++ comes with a library that is chock
  full of reusable classes for you to build programs out of. This library is
  called The C++ Standard Library.
</p>
<p><strong>The Standard Library</strong></p>
<p>
  The Standard library contains a collection of classes that provide templated
  containers, algorithms, and iterators. If you need a common class or
  algorithm, odds are the standard library has it. The upside is that you can
  take advantage of these classes without having to write and debug the classes
  yourself, and the standard library does a good job providing reasonably
  efficient versions of these classes. The downside is that the standard library
  is complex, and can be a little intimidating since everything is templated.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, you can bite off the standard library in tiny pieces, using only
  what you need from it, and ignore the rest until you’re ready to tackle it.
</p>
<p>
  In the next few lessons, we’ll take a high-level look at the types of
  containers, algorithms, and iterators that the standard library provides. Then
  in subsequent lessons, we’ll dig into some of the specific classes.
