  In this section, we’ll address some of the common issues that new programmers
  seem to run across with fairly high probability. This is not meant to be a
  comprehensive list of compilation or execution problems, but rather a
  pragmatic list of solutions to very basic issues. If you have any suggestions
  for other issues that might be added to this list, post them in the comments

    This will cause your program to wait for the user to press a key before
    continuing, which will give you time to examine your program’s output before
    your operating system closes the console window.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other solutions, such as the commonly suggested system(“pause”) solution may
    only work on certain operating systems and should be avoided.
  </p>
  <p>
    Older versions of Visual Studio may not pause when the program is run in
    <em>Start With Debugging (F5)</em> mode. Try running in
    <em>Start Without Debugging (Ctrl-F5)</em> mode.

  <p>
    This means your compiler can’t find your main() function. All programs must
    include a main() function.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a few things to check:<br />a) Does your code include a function
    named main?<br />b) Is main spelled correctly?<br />c) When you compile your
    program, do you see the file that contains function main() get compiled? If
    not, either move the main() function to one that is, or add the file to your
    project (see lesson
    <a
      href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/programs-with-multiple-code-files/"
      >2.8 -- Programs with multiple code files</a
    >
    for more information about how to do this).<br />d) Did you create a console
    project? Try creating a new console project.

    A C++ program is only allowed to have a single function named
    <code>main</code>. Your C++ program has more than one. Examine the files in
    your project and delete all <code>main</code> functions except one.

    If your compiler is old, it may not support these more recent additions to
    the language. In that case, upgrade your compiler.
  </p>
  <p>
    For modern IDEs/compilers, your compiler may be defaulting to an older
    language standard. We cover how to change your language standard in lesson

    Q: When I compile my program, I get an error that it cannot open the .exe

  </p>
  <p>
    This means the linker is trying to create your executable, but it can’t.
    This can happen for quite a few reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Most commonly, the .exe is currently running. A running executable can’t
      be replaced while it is running. Close the running .exe and recompile.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your antivirus or malware protection is preventing the executable from
      being created or replaced.
    </li>
    <li>
      The .exe already exists and is currently locked for some other reason. Try
      rebooting (to force any locks to be released), then recompile.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In Visual Studio, this is error LNK1168.</p>

    Q: When trying to use cin, cout, or endl, the compiler says cin, cout, or
    endl is an ‘undeclared identifier’
  </p>
  <p>
    First, make sure you have included the following line near the top of your
    file:
  </p>
  <div class="code-toolbar">
    <pre
      class="line-numbers language-cpp"
      tabindex="0"
    ><code class="match-braces language-cpp"><span class="token macro property"><span class="token directive-hash">#</span><span class="token directive keyword">include</span> <span class="token string">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span style="height: 16px;"></span></span><span class="line-numbers-sizer" style="display: none;"></span></code></pre>

        >
          <span>Copy</span>
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    Second, make sure each use of cin, cout, and endl are prefixed by “std::”.
    For example:
  </p>
  <div class="code-toolbar">
    <pre
      class="line-numbers language-cpp"
      tabindex="0"
    ><code class="match-braces language-cpp">std<span class="token double-colon punctuation">::</span>cout <span class="token operator">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="token string">"Broccoli"</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;&lt;</span> std<span class="token double-colon punctuation">::</span>endl<span class="token punctuation">;</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span style="height: 16px;"></span></span><span class="line-numbers-sizer" style="display: none;"></span></code></pre>
    <div class="toolbar">
      <div class="toolbar-item">
        <button
          class="copy-to-clipboard-button"
          type="button"
          data-copy-state="copy"
        >
          <span>Copy</span>
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    If this doesn’t fix your issue, then it may be that your compiler is out of
    date, or the install is corrupted. Try reinstalling and/or upgrading to the
    latest version of your compiler.

    Q: When trying to use endl to end a printed line, the compiler says end1 is
    an ‘undeclared identifier’
  </p>
  <p>
    Make sure you do not mistake the letter l (lower case L) in endl for the
    number 1. endl is all letters. Make sure your editor is using a font that
    makes clear the differences between the letter lower case L, upper case i,
    and the number 1. Also the letter capital o and the number zero can easily
    be confused in many non-programming fonts.

<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">
    Q: When compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, you get a C1010 fatal error,
    with an error message like "c:\vcprojects\test.cpp(263) :fatal error C1010:
    unexpected end of file while looking for precompiled header directive"
  </p>
  <p>
    This error occurs when the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is set to use
    precompiled headers but one (or more) of your C++ code files does not
    #include “stdafx.h” or #include “pch.h” as the first line of the code file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our suggested fix is to turn off precompiled headers, which we show how to
    do in lesson
    <a
      href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/compiling-your-first-program/"
      >0.7 -- Compiling your first program</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would like to keep precompiled headers turned on, to fix this
    problem, simply locate the file(s) producing the error (in the above error,
    test.cpp is the culprit), and add the following line at the very top of the
    file(s):

    Older versions of Visual Studio use “stdafx.h” instead of “pch.h”, so if
    pch.h doesn’t resolve the issue, try stdafx.h.

    Note that for programs with multiple files, every C++ code file needs to
    start with this line.

    Q: I have some other problem that I can’t figure out. How can I get an
    answer quickly?
  </p>
  <p>
    As you progress through the material, you’ll undoubtedly have questions or
    run into unexpected problems. What to do next depends on your problem. But
    in general, there are a few things you can try.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, <strong>ask a search engine</strong>. Find a good way to phrase your
    question and do a search. If you are searching an error message, paste in
    the exact error message using quotes (exclude any filenames or line
    numbers). Odds are someone has already asked the same question and there is
    an answer waiting for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, <strong>ask an AI</strong> like
    <a href="https://www.bing.com/chat">ChatGPT via Bing</a>. Start your
    question with “In C++,” to get a C++ specific answer. Some ideas for things
    you can ask for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      An explanation of some concept (e.g. “In C++, what is a local variable?”).
    </li>
    <li>
      The difference between two things (e.g. “In C++, what is the difference
      between a pointer and a reference?”)
    </li>
    <li>
      A demonstration of a concept (e.g. “In C++, write a short program that
      adds two numbers”)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note that AIs may return inaccurate or outdated information, and the
    programs they write will probably not follow modern best practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the above fails, <strong>ask on a Q&amp;A board</strong>. There are
    websites designed for programming questions and answers, like
    <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. Try posting your
    question there. Remember to be thorough about what your problem is, and
    include all relevant information like what OS you’re on and what IDE you’re
    using.
