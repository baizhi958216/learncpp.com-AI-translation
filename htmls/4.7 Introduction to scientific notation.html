  Before we talk about our next subject, we’re going to sidebar into the topic
  of scientific notation.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Scientific notation</strong> is a useful shorthand for writing lengthy
  numbers in a concise manner. And although scientific notation may seem foreign
  at first, understanding scientific notation will help you understand how
  floating point numbers work, and more importantly, what their limitations are.
</p>
<p>
  Numbers in scientific notation take the following form: <em>significand</em> x
  10<sup><em>exponent</em></sup
  >. For example, in the scientific notation <code>1.2 x 10⁴</code>,
  <code>1.2</code> is the significand and <code>4</code> is the exponent. Since
  10⁴ evaluates to 10,000, 1.2 x 10⁴ evaluates to 12,000.
</p>
<p>
  By convention, numbers in scientific notation are written with one digit
  before the decimal point, and the rest of the digits afterward.
</p>
<p>
  Consider the mass of the Earth. In decimal notation, we’d write this as
  <code>5972200000000000000000000 kg</code>. That’s a really large number (too
  big to fit even in an 8 byte integer). It’s also hard to read (is that 19 or
  20 zeros?). Even with separators (5,972,200,000,000,000,000,000,000) the
  number is still hard to read.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  In scientific notation, this would be written as
  <code>5.9722 x 10²⁴ kg</code>, which is much easier to read. Scientific
  notation has the added benefit of making it easier to compare the magnitude of
  two extremely large or small numbers simply by comparing the exponent.
</p>
<p>
  Because it can be hard to type or display exponents in C++, we use the letter
  ‘e’ (or sometimes ‘E’) to represent the “times 10 to the power of” part of the
  equation. For example, <code>1.2 x 10⁴</code> would be written as
  <code>1.2e4</code>, and <code>5.9722 x 10²⁴</code> would be written as
  <code>5.9722e24</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For numbers smaller than 1, the exponent can be negative. The number
  <code>5e-2</code> is equivalent to <code>5 * 10⁻²</code>, which is
  <code>5 / 10²</code>, or <code>0.05</code>. The mass of an electron is
  <code>9.1093837e-31 kg</code>.

    If you’re using arch linux and the superscript of <code>5 * 10⁻²</code> is
    missing the negative sign, you may need to install a font that can display
    these characters. See

  Significant digits
</p>
<p>
  Let’s say you need to know the value of the mathematical constant pi for some
  equation, but you’ve forgotten. You ask two people. One tells you the value of
  pi is <code>3.14</code>. The other tells you the value of pi is
  <code>3.14159</code>. Both of these values are “correct”, but the latter is
  far more precise.
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<p>
  Here’s the most important thing to understand about scientific notation: The
  digits in the significand (the part before the ‘e’) are called the
  <strong>significant digits</strong> (or <strong>significant figures</strong>).
  The more significant digits, the more precise a number is.
</p>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Key insight</p>
  <p>The more digits in the significand, the more precise a number is.</p>
</div>
<p>
  In scientific notation, we’d write <code>3.14</code> as <code>3.14e0</code>.
  Since there are 3 numbers in the significand, this number has 3 significant
  digits.
</p>
<p>
  <code>3.14159</code> would be written as <code>3.14159e0</code>. Since there
  are 6 numbers in the significand, this number has 6 significant digits.

  How to convert decimal numbers to scientific notation
</p>
<p>Use the following procedure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your exponent starts at zero.</li>
  <li>
    If the number has no explicit decimal point (e.g. <code>123</code>), it is
    implicitly on the right end (e.g. <code>123.</code>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Slide the decimal point left or right so there is only one non-zero digit to
    the left of the decimal.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each place you slide the decimal point to the left increases the
        exponent by 1.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each place you slide the decimal point to the right decreases the
        exponent by 1.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Trim off any leading zeros (on the left end of the significand)</li>
  <li>
    Trim off any trailing zeros (on the right end of the significand) only if
    the original number had no decimal point. We’re assuming they’re not
    significant. If you have additional information to suggest they are
    significant, you can keep them.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s some examples:</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<pre>
Start with: 600.410
Slide decimal point left 2 spaces: 6.00410e2
No leading zeros to trim: 6.00410e2
Don't trim trailing zeros: 6.00410e2 (6 significant digits)
</pre>
<pre>
Start with: 0.0078900
Slide decimal point right 3 spaces: 0007.8900e-3
Trim leading zeros: 7.8900e-3
Don't trim trailing zeros: 7.8900e-3 (5 significant digits)
</pre>
<pre>
Start with: 42030 (no information to suggest the trailing zero is significant)
Slide decimal point left 4 spaces: 4.2030e4
No leading zeros to trim: 4.2030e4
Trim trailing zeros: 4.203e4 (4 significant digits)
</pre>
<pre>
Start with: 42030 (assuming the trailing zero is significant)
Slide decimal point left 4 spaces: 4.2030e4
No leading zeros to trim: 4.2030e4
Keep trailing zeros: 4.2030e4 (5 significant digits)
</pre>

  Handling trailing zeros
</p>
<p>
  Consider the case where we ask two lab assistants each to weigh the same
  apple. One returns and says the apple weighs 87.0 grams. The other returns and
  says the apple weighs 87.000 grams. Let’s assume the weighing is correct. In
  the former case, the actual weight of the apple could be anywhere between
  86.950 and 87.049 grams. Maybe the scale was only precise to the nearest tenth
  of a gram. Or maybe our assistant rounded a bit. In the latter case, we are
  confident about the actual weight of the apple to a much higher degree (it
  actually weighs between 86.99950 and 87.00049 grams, which has much less
  variability).
</p>
<p>
  When converting to scientific notation, trailing zeros after a decimal point
  are considered significant, so we keep them:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>87.0g = 8.70e1</li>
  <li>87.000g = 8.7000e1</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For numbers with no decimal point, trailing zeros are considered to be
  insignificant by default. Given the number 2100 (with no additional
  information), we assume the trailing zeroes are not significant, so we drop
  them:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>2100 = 2.1e3 (trailing zeros assumed not significant)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  However, if we happened to know that this number was measured precisely (or
  that the actual number was somewhere between 2099.5 and 2100.5), then we
  should instead treat those zeros as significant:
</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-5" style="margin: 8px 0; clear: both"></div>
<ul>
  <li>2100 = 2.100e3 (trailing zeros known significant)</li>
</ul>
<div class="cpp-note cpp-lightbluebackground" data-ezoic-video-excluded="1">
  <p class="cpp-note-title cpp-bottomline">Tip</p>
  <p>
    You may occasionally see a number written with an explicit trailing decimal
    point. This is an indication that the preceding zeros are significant.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>2100. = 2.100e3 (trailing zeros known significant)</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p>
  One of the nice things about scientific notation is that it always makes clear
  how many digits are significant.
</p>
<p>
  From a technical standpoint, the numbers 87.0 and 87.000 have the same value
  (and the same type). When C++ stores either of these numbers in memory, it
  will store just the value 87. And once stored, there is no way to determine
  from the stored value which of the two numbers was originally input.
</p>
<p>
  Now that we’ve covered scientific notation, we’re ready to cover floating
  point numbers.

<p>
  Convert the following numbers to scientific notation (using an e to represent
  the exponent) and determine how many significant digits each has.

  Remember, keep trailing zeros after a decimal point, drop trailing zeros if
